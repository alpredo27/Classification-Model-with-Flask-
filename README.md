# Classification-Model-with-Flask-

1. Created this sample Binary CLassification model to use Flask and Pickle libraries in deploying of machine learning model.
2. Take note that the logistic regression model built here did not go through the correct process of model development. Hence, No EDA and Model performance checking were done.
3. For simplicity, only numerical factors of the data set were considered in the model built. 
4. Created a simple HTML containing 3 fields where the user will input the necessary values to predict the output variable.
