# Classification-Model-with-Flask-

### Objective:
   Considering that most Machine Learning models built don't reach the deployment phase, I created this simple project to try deploying an ML Model using Flask and Pickle.

### Details:
   #### Data Used: 
   Bank Marketing Data Set c/o UCI Machine Learning Respository. You may access the data on this [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#).

   #### Summary: 
   1. Created this simple Binary Classification model to use **Flask** and **Pickle** libraries in deploying of machine learning model.
   2. Take note that the logistic regression model built here did not go through the correct process of model development. Hence, No EDA and Model performance checking were done.
   3. For simplicity, only numerical factors of the data set were considered in the model built. 
   4. Created a simple HTML containing 3 fields where the user will input the necessary values to predict the output variable.
   #### For Improvement: 
   1. Go back to the model development process and build a good performing classification model which includes all the data available, then update the pickle file attached to this project. 
   2. Improve the HTML app created in terms of UI and context about the fields to inputted are in place. 
   3. Due to model improvement which can translate to consideration of additional features, the flask should be updated as well where prepocessing such as feature scaling and feature engineering will have to be added.
